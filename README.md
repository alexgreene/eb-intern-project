# whats-happening

What's Happening? uses the Eventbrite API to collect information on popular events in a given city. 
It then displays interesting averages and data representing those events, along with a number
of histograms and charts displaying data on event times, capacities, and top categories.

For example, here's what you might see after a search of Pittsburgh (PA).

### Room for improvement
Only searches through 50 popular events, which is not be enough to be statistically significant. 
Some locations have fewer than 50 popular events, but some have far more. This could slow down the site considerably.

Would be interesting to compare the same variables/averages against data from the entire list of events (not just most popular).
This could give us a better picture of what correlates to more popular events in a given area, and might be valuable for event hosts in that area.

Event pricing data would be a great thing to include.
